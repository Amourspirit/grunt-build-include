with html comments, quotes, space file: ( './replace1.txt' )

In a sentence, file: ("./replace1.txt")
This part is permanent. THIS IS NOT: //BUILD_INCLUDE("./replace1.txt")

Lower case build_include, flie: ("./replace1.txt")
// build_include("./replace1.txt")

Mixed case build_include file: (  ./replace1.txt  )
// Build_Include(  ./replace1.txt  )

with space on both sides of quote, file: (  "  ./replace1.txt  "   )
//BUILD_INCLUDE(  "  ./replace1.txt  "   )

with file that spaces in the name, file: ( "./replacement file 01.txt" )
// BUILD_INCLUDE( "./replacement file 01.txt" )

with file that spaces in the name not using quotes, file: ( ./replacement file 01.txt )
// BUILD_INCLUDE( ./replacement file 01.txt )
