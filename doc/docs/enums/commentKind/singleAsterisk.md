Format using prefix of: `*`

Useful for comment replacement that is required inline.

**Example:**  
If you have the following.

```js
/**
 * [[include:doc/myMarkdown.md]]
 */
```

The output would be similar to the following.

```js
/**
 * my multi line comments
 * comments continue on this line
 */
```
