Format using prefix of: `*`

Useful for comment replacement that is required inline.

**Example:**  
If you have the following.

> \/\*\*  
> \* \[\[include:doc/myMarkdown.md\]\]  
> *\/

The output would be similar to the following.

> \/\*\*  
> \* my multi line comments  
> \* comments continue on this line  
> \*\/
